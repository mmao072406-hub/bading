    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #90c7fa;"> (born March 30, 1853, Zundert, Netherlands—died July 29, 1890, Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, France)</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #4a4981;"> was a Dutch painter, generally considered one of the greatest of the Post-Impressionists.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffffff;"> Van Gogh started his artistic career rather late, beginning at age 27. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffffff;">In the decade that followed he created an astonishingly large body of work, consisting of some 900 paintings and 1,100 drawings.</p> 
    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffffff;">His unique personal style, noted for its striking color, emphatic brushwork, and contoured forms, was realized only in the last three years of his life.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffffff;">Although van Gogh sold little of his art while he was alive, his work was a powerful influence on the Expressionist movement in modern art and became astoundingly popular after his death. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffffff;">published letters, notably those to his devoted brother Theo van Gogh, document the artist’s struggles with mental health and poverty, and, in part may have contributed to his mythology in the popular imagination as the quintessential tortured artist.</p>
